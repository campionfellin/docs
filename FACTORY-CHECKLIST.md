# Checklist for Factory/Playground Projects

## Upload
- Submit one field at a time. Wait for that transaction to clear before attempting the next field.
- When you upload your script, please copy it exactly from testnet.
- Include the following in the Project Base URI field: `https://api.artblocks.io/token/`

## Economics
- Consider the overall economics of your project for a successful release.
- Artists can only have one active project at a time.
- There is a one month cooling period between the end of one project and the start of the next.

## Mint #0
- Once your project information has been uploaded, please confirm that you're ready for mint #0.

## Features
- Please provide your features script in conjunction with mint #0.

## Scheduling
- Once mint #0 and the features script are in place, you may schedule/announce your release.

## Limiter
- For factory/playground projects, the limiter will be turned off by default.
- Please let us know if you'd like the limiter to be activated for your project.
- The limiter will restrict purchases to one mint per wallet for a specified amount of time after drop.

## Unpausing
- When it's time, you'll click the Unpause button under the Danger tab.
- Once the transaction clears, your project will be live for minting.

## Rarities
- Do not discuss odds or feature rarities about your project until it is completely sold out.
